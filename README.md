# ArcadeAutomation
This was created to automate the commit process for Arcade and automatically commits code to GitHub and runs slack commands for users every hour.\
To commit, I use the command line and the following commands:\
    git init\
    git add --all\
    git commit -m "<user message>"\
    git branch -M main\
    git remote add origin <origin>\
    git push -u origin main

Make sure you have tkinter, pygame, selenium, and math libraries installed.\
Keep the geckodriver excecutable in this folder.# RealVersusFake
